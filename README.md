# Freight Distribution Planning in Hammersmith and Fulham

This notebook is produced as part of the Transport Systems module at Imperial College London, supervised by Dr Panagiotis Angeloudis. We were hired by a rapid grocery delivery start-up to establish a network of hyperlocal last-mile distribution depots around London, with delivery times of 7 minutes or less. The objective of the brief is to develop a facility selection strategy that would allow testing of the concept before further expansion. The company would like to test the concept in the London Borough Hammersmith and Fulham, as part of a year-long trial.
